# ALERT2 Technical Working Group Communications and Document Version Management Guide
June 18, 2017

The goal of this communications guide is to:

  * Document/establish procedures for managing and tracking communications among the ALERT2 TWG members, and  
  * Maintain document version management

## Communications Management

A Google Group account (ALERT2TWG@googlegroups.com) was established June 15, 2017.  Membership to this group is established by
invitation from the group administrator.  Members of the public may request membership.  All group communications are visible to the
public.

To initiate an email discussion, simply click the red "New Topic" button in the upper left of the ALERT2 TWG group site page:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alert2twg, create your message and hit the "post" button. The process has the look and feel of
an email exchange.  Subsequent replys within the same topic are just like an email reply.

Typicial group discussion topics include ALERT2 specification proposals, TWG coordination etc.. This Google Group includes all members
of the ALERT2 TWG. Members are encouraged to use filters to manage the incoming messages and to take advantage of the many handy account
settings designed to help track topics of interest.  Making this list public and including the entire TWG promotes openness and 
accountability, and establishes a historical, searchable record of decision-making rationale.

## Document Management (working documents)

A GitHub account (https://github.com/ALERT2TWG/documentation) was established June 15, 2017 to facilitate version control and tracking
of documents developed by the TWG.  Any type of document format, such as MS Word, PDF, .txt etc... can be submitted to the ALERT2 TWG
GitHub by any TWG member.  Any member of the ALERT2 TWG may check out or request the latest version of any of the ALERT2 TWG working
documents for editing.  Once editing is complete, the changed document is simply re-uploaded directly to the ALERT2 TWG GitHub
repository via a pull request to the TWG's GitHub administrator.

## Final Documents

Final ALERT2 TWG documents are additionally stored/archived for easy public access within the National Hydrologic Warning Council
ALERT2 document portal: http://hydrologicwarning.org/content.aspx?page_id=86&club_id=617218&item_id=11986  This location also contains
draft proposed (new) or updated ALERT2 protocol documents during their public review period.  Final and draft documents which have been
made available for public review are saved in pdf format.
