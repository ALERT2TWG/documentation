# ALERT2 Technical Working Group Communications and Document Version Management Guide
June 14, 2017

The goal of this communications guide is to:

  * Document/establish procedures for managing and tracking communications among the ALERT2 TWG members, and  
  * Maintain document version management

## Communications Management

A Google Groups email account (ALERT2TWG@groups.google.com) has been created.  Membership to this group is established by invitation
from the group administrator.  Members of the public may request membership.  All group communications are visible to the public.

To initiate an email discussion, simply click the red "New Topic" button in the upper left of the ALERT2 TWG group site page:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alert2twg

When you receive an email from the group on a particular topic, simply reply to the group email to add your contribution to the
discussion of that topic.

Typcial group discussion topics include ALERT2 specification proposals, questions, TWG coordination, announcements etc..
This email group includes all members of the ALERT2 TWG.
Members are encouraged to use filters to manage the incoming emails.
Making this list public and including the entire TWG promotes openness and accountability, and establishes a historical,
searchable record of decision-making rationale.

## Document Management (working documents)

A GitHub account has been established to perform version control and tracking of documents developed by the TWG.  Any type of
document format, such as MS Word, PDF etc... can be submitted to the ALERT2 TWG GitHub by any TWG member.  alternatively, material
can be provided to the the TWG's GitHub coordinator or the chair of the ALERT2 TWG.  Any member of the ALERT2 TWG may check out or
request the latest form of any of the ALERT2 TWG documents for editing.  Once editing is complete, the changed document is simply
re-uploaded directly to the ALERT2 TWG GitHub repository or provided to the ALERT2 TWG GitHub administrator.

## Final Documents

Final ALERT2 TWG documents are additionally stored/archived for easy public access within the National Hydrologic Warning Council
ALERT2 document portal: http://hydrologicwarning.org/content.aspx?page_id=86&club_id=617218&item_id=11986

This location also contains draft proposed/modified ALERT2 protocol documents during their public review period.

Final documents and draft documents which have been made available for public review are saved in pdf format.
